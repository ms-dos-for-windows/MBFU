Regarding MS-DOS 5.0, 6.22, MS-DOS BOOT FROM USB is the only program that can fully write these versions of MS-DOS to a USB flash drive, just as other programs write floppy disk images of these OS into the boot sector, as a result of which the system is cleared into RAM memory and does not save changes on the disk.
